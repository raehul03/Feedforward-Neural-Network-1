This Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) uses TensorFlow/Keras for binary classification on a synthetic dataset.
Generate random data (1000 samples, 10 features).
Split & scale data (train/val/test).
Build a 3-layer neural network with ReLU & sigmoid.
Train with Adam & binary cross-entropy (20 epochs).
Evaluate & plot accuracy curves.
